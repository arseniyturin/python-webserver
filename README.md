# Python Webserver
Tiny webserver written in pure Python that can serve static html pages with images and stylesheets. No dependencies, just standard library. Written in Python 3.9 but could work under 2.7 with small changes.

Made for educational purposes to understand how HTTP works as well as how to send and receive TCP packets with low-level `socket` library.

## How to run
In terminal type `python server.py [port]`
